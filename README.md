# Watch me edit ðŸ–¥

One of the best things about pair programming is learning about the tooling that
other developers use to get their work done. The idea with this project is to reduce
the idea of "watch me code" to just "watch me edit". Your goal is to transform the 
project in the `src/old` folder to the project in the `src/new` folder.

In this case this means converting the CSV to JSON and adapting the code to load the JSON
instead. Your final code should look exactly as it does in the `src/new` folder. Don't change
any details of the code, this is really just about seeing *how* you apply 
your edits, not why.

## Rules
- Work on the code in `src/old`
- Transform it until it looks like the code in `src/new`
- Don't copy any code from `src/new`
- You can use whatever tooling you want, from `awk/sed` to a full blown IDE, this is about 
watching how *you* work.

## Recording
In order to share your approach with others, create a screen recording. Make
sure to use a tool such as [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) so
that viewers can follow exactly what you are doing.
